# Jarvis Project

## Introduction

The Jarvis Project is an advanced voice-activated assistant that leverages a suite of AI technologies, including speech-to-text and text-to-speech, backed by the power of ChatGPT. It features a scalable Django backend and a responsive React frontend, with data management handled by MySQL and Redis for persistent storage and efficient data access. Designed with scalability and extensibility in mind, Jarvis operates within a Dockerized environment, facilitating easy setup and deployment. This project stands out by integrating extensive AI agents, each equipped with multiple APIs to offer a wide range of functionalities and services, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and integrations.

## Features

- Voice-activated interaction with extensive AI agent support
- Integration with ChatGPT and other AI APIs for intelligent processing
- Scalable and extensible architecture ready for future growth
- Django backend for robust application management
- Reactive React frontend for an interactive user experience
- MySQL Server for persistent storage solutions
- Redis database for fast data retrieval and caching
- Docker containerization for simplified setup and scalability

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. Docker is essential for running the application containers. You can download and install Docker from [https://www.docker.com/get-started](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    Clone the repository to your local machine to get started:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Googly-Boogly/Jarvis
    ```

2. **Configure the Application**

    In the cloned repository, modify the `docker-compose.yml` file by replacing `<changeme>` paths with your specific paths. Then, populate the `config.yaml` file with your API keys to activate all features.

3. **Launch the Application**

    From the root of your project directory, execute the following command in the terminal to start all required Docker containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

    This command builds and initiates the Jarvis Project containers.

4. **Access the Interface**

    With the application running, access the Jarvis web interface by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## Usage

Interact with the Jarvis assistant through the web interface. It can understand voice commands and questions, responding through its AI agents' capabilities. The system's design allows for the easy addition of new AI agents and APIs, ensuring Jarvis remains at the forefront of AI assistant technology.
